## About me
Hi! I am Akshay Hinduja, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Michael Kaess](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/) at the [Robot Perception Lab](https://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/). I also obtained my Master's from CMU, advised by [Prof. Kenji Shimada](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html).

I work on perception and SLAM, mainly for underwater robots. My interests lie in the development of field robots to achieve autonomy. My current focus is on making cheaper underwater robots perform as robustly as their far more expensive counterparts. 

Apart from research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, be it on foot or my mountain bike! From time to time, I also enjoy painting, astrophotography and reading!
