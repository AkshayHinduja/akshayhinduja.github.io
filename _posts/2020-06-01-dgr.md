## Abstract
We present Deep Global Registration, a differentiable framework for pairwise registration of real-world 3D scans. 

Deep global registration is based on three modules: 
- a 6-dimensional convolutional network for correspondence confidence prediction, 
- a differentiable Weighted Procrustes algorithm for closed-form pose estimation, 
- and a robust gradient-based SE(3) optimizer for pose refinement. 

Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both learning-based and classical, on real-world data.
