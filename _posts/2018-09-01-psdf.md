## Abstract
We propose a novel 3D spatial representation for data fusion
and scene reconstruction. Probabilistic Signed Distance Function (Probabilistic SDF, PSDF) is proposed to depict uncertainties in the 3D
space. It is modeled by a joint distribution describing SDF value and
its inlier probability, reflecting input data quality and surface geometry.

A hybrid data structure involving voxel, surfel, and mesh is designed to
fully exploit the advantages of various prevalent 3D representations. Connected by PSDF, these components reasonably cooperate in a consistent
framework. Given sequential depth measurements, PSDF can be incrementally refined with less ad hoc parametric Bayesian updating. Supported by PSDF and the efficient 3D data representation, high-quality
surfaces can be extracted on-the-fly, and in return contribute to reliable data fusion using the geometry information. 

Experiments demonstrate that our system reconstructs scenes with higher model quality and
lower redundancy, and runs faster than existing online mesh generation
systems.
